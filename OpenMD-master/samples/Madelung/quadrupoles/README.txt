This directory contains a set of quadrupolar crystals that can be used
to test electrostatic energies for quadrupole-quadrupole interactions.
The quadrupolar analogues to the structural Madelung constants for
ionic crystals were first worked out by Nagai and Nakamura who
computed the energies of certain selected quadrupole arrays and
obtained a number of these constants.[1] Their work is based on
earlier work on dipolar crystals that was done by Luttinger & Tisza
[2].  We have generated only the lowest energy configurations for the
linear quadrupoles

The electrostatic energy for one of these dipolar arrays is

  E = C (3/4) N^2 Q^2

where C is the energy constant above, N is the number of quadrupoles
per unit volume, and Q is the strength of the dipole.

In the units used by OpenMD, with quadrupole moments of 1
Debye-angstrom, lengths in angstroms, and energies reported in
kcal / mol, the electrostatic energies are:

  E = 14.39325 (3/4) C N^2 Q^2

E here is an energy density, so it must be multiplied by the total
volume of the box.
