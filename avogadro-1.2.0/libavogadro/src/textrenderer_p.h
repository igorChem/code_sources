/**
 * @class TextRenderer
 * @internal
 * @author Benoit Jacob
 *
 * NOTE: This class is only there as a temporary replacement for
 * QGLWidget::renderText(). As of Qt 4.2.3 and Qt 4.3-beta1, this function is
 * too slow and can't do outlined text. If a future version of Qt brings a
 * sufficiently improved QGLWidget::renderText(), we will of course drop this class.
 *
 * This class renders text inside a QGLWidget. It replaces the functionality
 * of QGLWidget::renderText().
 *
 * Its advantages over the renderText() in Qt 4.2.3 are that it is much faster both at
 * render-time and at startup, consumes less memory, and does outlined text. Its drawbacks are that
 * it can't yet handle rendering more than one font simultaneously, and that its Unicode-safeness is
 * not perfect as superpositions of unicode characters aren't handled.
 *
 * Every QFont can be used, every character encodings supported by Qt can be used.
 *
 * To draw plain 2D text on top of the scene, do:
 * @code
 textRenderer.begin();
 textRenderer.draw( x1, y1, string1 );
 textRenderer.draw( x2, y2, string2 );
 textRenderer.draw( x3, y2, string3 );
 textRenderer.end();
 * @endcode
 *
 * To draw text as a transparent object inside the scene, do:
 * @code
 textRenderer.begin();
 textRenderer.draw( pos1, string1 );
 textRenderer.draw( pos2, string2 );
 textRenderer.draw( pos3, string3 );
 textRenderer.end();
 * @endcode
 *
 * In order to set the text color, please call glColor3f or glColor4f before
 * calling draw(). Of course you can
 * also call qglColor or Color::apply(). You can achieve semitransparent text at
 * no additional cost by choosing a semitransparent color.
 *
 * Please make sure that no relevant OpenGL state change occurs between
 * begin() and end(), except the state changes performed by the TextRenderer
 * itself. In other words, please avoid calling glSomething() between begin() and
 * end(), except if you are sure that this call won't result in a conflicting state
 * change. Of course calling glColor*() is allowed.
 *
 * If you experience rendering problems, you can try the following:
 * - disable some OpenGL state bits. For instance, TextRenderer automatically
 *   disables fog and lighting during rendering, because it doesn't work
 *   correctly with them enabled. There probably are other OpenGL state bits
 *   that have to be disabled, so if your program enables some of them, you
 *   might have to disable them before rendering text.
 * - if you experience poor font quality, meake sure that your GLWidget is using
 *   an antialiased font.
