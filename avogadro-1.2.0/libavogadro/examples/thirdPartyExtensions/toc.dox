\section intro Introduction

This tutorial is designed to guide new developers who are interested
in writing third party (e.g. out-of-source) extensions to Avogadro. It
assumes that the reader has a working knowledge of C++ and is familiar
with the basic usage of Qt Designer. If you are not familiar with
Designer, a link to the Qt Designer tutorial is provided at the bottom
of this page.
