\section avogadro Introduction

Avogadro is a molecular modeling / viewing / editing tool. More
importantly, it is a platform for developing chemical and molecular
visualization and interactive simulations.

The core design allows every feature to be extended via a plugin. This
allows new features and tools to be easily added and removed and
extension into new applications. Almost every feature in Avogadro is
developed as a plugin, so the source code itself serves as examples for other developers.

\subsection main Main Classes

Plugins for extending Avogadro:
- Color : Interface for coloring atoms, bonds, etc.
- Engine : Interface for display types: graphical styles for rendering molecules and other data
- Extension : Interface for user menu commands
  - DockExtension : Interface for dock widgets
- Painter : General interface for graphical output: OpenGL, POVRay, etc.
- Tool : Interface for mouse tools

libavogadro classes: Main classes
- GLWidget : Widget for rendering 3d representations of a molecule.
- Navigate : Class for manipulating the 3d viewpoint
- Primitive : Base class for all model components
  - Molecule : Class for representing molecules
  - Atom : Class for representing atoms
  - Bond : Class for representing bonds
  - Residue : Class for representing residues

\subsection tutorial Tutorial

In many cases, if you want to add features to Avogadro, you wish to add an Extension or DockExtension. We have set up a series of tutorials for third-party extensions (i.e., building outside the main Avogadro source).
