GENERAL PURPOSE PARAMETER SET 3OB-2-1

name   requires    elements
3ob     -           C-H-N-O-P-S

short description:
DFTB3 files for bio and organic molecules

detailed description:
This set has been specifically designed for DFTB3 and supersedes the MIO
parameter set. Main improvements over MIO are improved geometries for 
non-covalent bonds as e.g. the hydrogen bond in the water dimer, a 
great reduction of the consistent overbinding and an overall improved
performance. Comprehensive benchmark tests for C-H-N-O can be found in 
[JCTC2013], for P-S-* in [tobepublished].


The following zeta and Hubbard derivative parameters should be used
for DFTB3 calculations (atomic units):
zeta: 4.00    (also called DampXHExponent)
C     -0.1492 (option HubbardDerivs in DFTB+)
H     -0.1857
N     -0.1535
O     -0.1575
P     -0.14
S     -0.11
